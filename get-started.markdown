    ## What *exactly* do I get from the Idea Inquest?

    Most freelancers or design agencies will offer you a fullproof development plan or marketing plan. What they don't do is tell you if your idea is even going to deliver on your expectations. The Idea Inquest delivers a strategy for your idea or existing business that *will* succeed.
  
    ## What happens after the Idea Inquest?

    Once the Idea Inquest is complete, you'll be left with an action plan for marketing, pitching, and building your idea. You can continue working with me, moving into an R&D phase where we plan out everything in detail to eliminate as much risk to you as possible, or you can take your idea to any agile development agency.
  
    ## How much does the Idea Inquest cost?

    That depends on your business needs. The Idea Inquest starts at $999 and the price will change based on your unique scenario.
