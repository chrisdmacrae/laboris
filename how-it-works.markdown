    What the Idea Inquest aims to solve 
  body: >
    Instead of rushing to turn your idea into a business — making mistakes about what features or services to build, who to target, and what to market to them — the Idea Inquest uses detailed systems, processes, and techniques to confront all of the unknowns about your idea. It leaves no about assumptions your audience, your competitors, and your industry so you can start you business at a steady pace.


    **The most common failures business founders make are:**

    - Making the incorrect assumptions about who their audience

    - Making the incorrect assumptions about what their audience want

    - Not pivoting enough from the competition to define their own category (link: law of category)

    - Spending too much money on all of the wrong things (like advertising)

    - Simply not asking for help about what they don’t know


    **The Idea Inquest will answer these questions:**

    - Who is your audience?

    - Will they actually care about your idea?

    - What features or services should you actually create?


    Let’s see exactly how this works…
- headline: Instead of potentially creating the wrong thing…
  body: >
    …we’ll research your audience through deep, unbiased observation throughout all of their possible watering holes on the internet. We do this because human beings are always biased. Whether it’s your assumptions, or an interviewee trying to make you happy, its simply unavoidable. But by observing people in their natural environment, we can get a much clearer picture. No more making the wrong assumptions, or getting biased answers from interviews.


    **You’ll get:**

    - A breakdown of the common world views your audience holds

    - An examination of all of the pains your audience expresses online

    - A pain prioritization graph that tells you exactly what you should focus on

    - All of the raw data for your own use
- headline: Instead of comparing yourself to your competitors…
  body: >
    …we’ll help you understand their word views and their strategies. We do this because a common mistake is trying to copy or improve on a competitors strategy, instead of defining your own unique category. This way you can look for holes in their approach and fill them, instead of trying to take the same castle.


    **You’ll get:**

    - A breakdown of your competitors world views and why they have them

    - An examination of what your competitors strengths and weaknesses are

    - A checklist of opportunities you can fill that your competitors aren’t
- headline: Instead of being unprepared for the world wide web… 
  body: >
    …we’ll do comprehensive SEO (search engine optimization) research to ensure all of your efforts are not only perfect for your audience, but planned to succeed on the internet. We do this because well-planned SEO allows you to show up when your audience is searching on the web, trying to solve their problems. This is free and very effective marketing, provided you get it right!

    
    **You’ll get:**

    - A list of SEO keyword opportunities

    - An action checklist for correctly implementing SEO for your business

We’ll find out what your audience wants to read or watch, how it should be written, and whether or not your competitors are up-to-snuff. Plus we’ll explain how to arrange into a marketing funnel, ensuring that it is efficient as possible.


    **You’ll get:**

    - Measurable insights into your audience’s comprehension level (Including reading level, preferred reading length, preferred language, and more)

    - An understanding of what content converts, as well as an understanding of how any of your existing content is converting.
