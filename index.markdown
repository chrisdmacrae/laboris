  headline: Why 90% of Startups Fail
  body: >
    Did you know that 90% of businesses fail because of premature scaling? This is because: 

    * They don’t know their audience.

    * They don’t have a working revenue model.

    * They haven’t created their own niche.

    * They simply don’t have a clear picture of their business.


    Due to these reasons, they recieve and spend too many invester dollars and can never pay back their debts.

    ## Does this sound scary to you?

    It doesn’t have to.


    * Founders that try to learn more about their business raise 7x more money and have 3.5x better user growth.

    * Startups that pivot once or twice raise 2.5x more money, have 3.6x better user growth, and are 52% less likely to scale prematurely.

    * Startups with a balanced team raise 30% more money.


    Your idea deserves as much attention as your actual business. My tested process ensures that you are planning something people want, understand the audience you’re targeting, have a working revenue model, and are creating your own niche. I’ll join you and your team, educate you on the whole process, and will help you pivot if necessary. All so that you have the clearest picture possible.


    I want to work with you to help you build the best business you can build.

  body: |
    The Idea Inquest is a proven process that is all about eliminating your risk. It guarantees to save your time and money by answering three very important questions about your business idea:
    * **Who is your audience?**<br>
      Do you actually know how your audience talks, thinks, and feels about your idea and your industry?
    * **Will they actually care about your idea?**<br>
      Do they have enough emotional involvement in the problem your solving to actually pay for it? How much?
    * **What features or services should you actually create?**<br>
      What common problems or pains are your audience actually looking to solve? No assumptions, no guessing. Just real data.

- headline: Get started for free with the simple Idea planning guide
  body: "Good ideas aren’t born overnight. They take patience, focus, and some tender
    love and care. Most importantly, ideas need a critical eye to ensure they’re simple
    enough to succeed.\n\n  > A complex system that works is invariably found to have
    evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch
    never works and cannot be patched up to make it work.\n  >John Gall\n\n![preview-image](https://www.knowyourcompany.com/assets/marketing/pubs-ac94851c9d781c8676854a126abcd73e.png)\n\nThe
    Idea Inquest planning guide gives you everything you need to validate your idea.
    It includes:\n* **The idea validation checklist.**<br>\n  Which takes you through
    all of the key questions you need to answer before you can call your idea business-ready.\n*
    **The audience pain exercise.**<br>\n  Which takes you through thinking critically
    about your audience, and whether or not you’re actually solving a problem for
    them.\n* **The worldview exercise.**<br>\n  Which helps you begin thinking about
    how your audience thinks and protects you from the problem of marketing to yourself."
